<h2>About Me</h2>
Hello, My name is Hannah Lee and my Korean name is Hyemin. I am building this website for CSCI S-12 Fundamamentals of Website Development with David Heitmeyer in the Summer of 2022 at Harvard Extension School. I am 34 years old and hail from Rancho Palos Verdes, California, a suburb of Los Angeles where I grew up. I went to UCLA after high school for a degree in English but never finished my degree; hence why I am still in college many years later. I am currently studying to get a ALB in Science at Harvard Extension School and an ALM in Software Engineering with the hopes of entering the field of quantum computing. Meanwhile I have taken various classes, including Music 190R Technomusicology, DGMD E9 Introduction to Digital Photography, as well as DGMD E35 Introduction to Video Editing. This website showcases some skills I have garnered during the past semesters. I hope you enjoy perusing my website!
