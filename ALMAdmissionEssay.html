    I’m interested in an ALM in Software Engineering. My goal with this program is to become a cutting-edge Quantum Computer programmer. The technology for quantum computers is still in its infancy; however, the all-encompassing potential of quantum computers has lured many players into the field. Countries like the U.S., China and South Korea and companies like IBM, Google and Microsoft all vie to be the first to take a step forward in this nascent and exciting industry.
<br><br>
    Cybersecurity, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Logistics and Finance are all examples of sectors poised to benefit from the coming revolution in quantum computing. For example, while modern computers lack the physical memory to model a complex yet common molecule like caffeine, it would potentially be a simple task for a quantum computer. If quantum computers can successfully model these types of organic molecules, not only would there be advancements in food science, but cures for formerly uncurable diseases may be soon discovered. As of now, chemists and biologists can only model and simulate natural processes in physical laboratories using trial-and-error to find new medicines and vaccines. With a quantum computer that can simulate a vast number of outcomes at once, a researcher would be much better equipped to efficiently find the most effective path in curing disease. 
    <br><br>
Quantum computing has the potential to disrupt the way we interact with technology in a fundamental way, much like Henry Ford’s Model T revolutionized transportation, or the way the Apple II modernized home computing- yet affecting every industry that relies on these now ubiquitous technologies. 
<br><br>
I am very aware of the potential disruption that technology poses. Growing up, my family owned a video rental store. I saw the video rental industry collapse nearly overnight with the rise of Netflix and the streaming industry. Our family business was no longer profitable due to inevitable advancements in technology. With this lesson in mind, I have learned to never become complacent in the wake of change. 
<br><br>
Following the closing of the video stores, our family opened a restaurant which I helped manage for 8 years, until 2016. In 2017 I moved to Boston and began working at Tufts Health Plan as a customer service rep. I am currently employed by Harvard University Mail Services. So, while my professional experience does not involve much software engineering, I have developed an interest in the field. I took JavaScript, CSS and HTML courses in community colleges while in California, developing a website for my swimming lesson business. In 2017 I enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development Program at the Lambda School. And more recently, I took Intro to Computer Science with Python with Professor Henry Leitner. In that class I developed the website quantumcomputinginfo.com to present my research on the subject. I have further planned the coursework required to understand quantum physics and quantum computing for coming semesters, including differential equations and linear algebra.  
<br><br>
While I was an English Major at UCLA, my brother took advanced math, first at community college and later at UC San Diego. His success in school and his subsequent career as a chemist inspired me to change my concentration to science. I will always have an interest in English Literature, and I am eager to bring my perspective into the study of quantum computing. 
<br><br>
The field of quantum science is compelling and will play a vital role in our future. Many countries and major companies have invested in quantum computing, and it is exciting to see who will develop groundbreaking technology in this growing field first. Quantum computing will allow us to model nature more accurately and with a precision that would revolutionize the way we comprehend science. The applications of quantum physics would result in greater industrial efficiency and provide innumerable material benefits to society. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of quantum physics would help humanity advance, answering questions we once deemed unanswerable.
